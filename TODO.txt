(URGENT) when merging schemas, we need to fill the missing attributes, not select which one has more attributes
    - for this, define empty = null || '' || []
    - if check both objects for empty values, if both are empty take either, take the one that is not empty
    - if the attribute is not null, pick the one that is the longest

(URGENT) fix merging of booking conditions( run iJhz 5432)
(URGENT) we havent check if the hotel_ids are none or not(same with destination_ids)





do we still need singleton? And how to do it?

Cases to think about: more complex urls? more hotels with different schemas?(nothing we can do about)
